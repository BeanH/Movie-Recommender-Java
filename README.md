Ever wonder how Netflix decides what movies to recommend for you? Or how Amazon recommends books? 

We can get a feel for how recommendations work by building a simplified system of our own!

This project  creats a simple recommender system. You will work with movies and movie ratings, but the principles involved can be adapted to books,restaurants, and more. 

The project determines which movies should be recommended to a user based on the ratings of several movies by people of similar age.
